Pipelines are document processoers that allow sequencing other document
processors (including other Pipelines) so they are accessible as one.</font>
<h4><font face="Verdana">The Pipelines Menu</font></h4>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Pipelines menu provides access to functions
for managing and applying Pipelines, and instant access to a set of built-in Pipelines:</font>
<ul>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Create:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;Create
    a new Pipeline by sequencing some document processors.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Edit:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;Open
    the Pipeline management dialog.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Run:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;Select
    an Pipeline from a list and apply it to the document currently selected.
    This function is also available through the&nbsp;<b>Run Pipeline </b>option
    in the Tools menu.</font></li>
</ul>
<h4><font face="Verdana">The Edit Pipelines Dialog</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">The dialog for Pipeline management is accessible
through the Edit function in the Pipelines menu. On the right of the dialog, a
list displays all existing Pipelines. In the middle, a table displays the
individual document processors in the order they are applied by the Pipeline
currently selected in that list. Below and to the left of the table, there are
several buttons for managing the document processors that are part of the
Pipeline:</font>
<ul>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Remove:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;Remove
    the document processor(s) currently selected in the table.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Add ...&quot; Buttons:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>
    </b>For every type of document processor accessible to GoldenGATE, a button
    exists which opens a dialog for selecting a processor from a list and adding
    it to the end of the Pipeline. If the new document processor is a Pipeline
    itself, an automated cycle detection will ensure that no cycles occur.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Interactivity Level:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;Below
    the buttons, there is a selector for the Pipeline's interactivity level,
    i.e. the frequency documents running through the Pipeline are presented to
    the user for manual interventions. There are five different interactivity
    levels:</font><ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Feedback / Editing after each step:</b>
    Allow the document processors to prompt the user whenever necessary, display
    the document for manual editing after each individual document processor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Feedback / Editing of result:</b> Allow
    the document processors to prompt the user whenever necessary, display the
    document for manual editing after the Pipeline has finished its work. This
    is the default.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Feedback only:</b> Allow the document
    processors to prompt the user whenever necessary, do not display the
    document for manual editing.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Editing of result only:</b> Force the
    document processors to work autonomously, but display the document for
    manual editing after the Pipeline has finished its work.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>No interactivity:</b> Force the document
    processors to work autonomously, do not display the document for manual
    editing.</font></li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Up:</b>&nbsp;Move the document processor
    currently selected in the table up by one row.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Down:</b>&nbsp;Move the document
    processor currently selected in the table down by one row.</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">At the top of the dialog, a
line of buttons provides the functionality for managing the Pipelines:</font>
<ul>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Create:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;Open
    a sub-dialog for creating a new Pipeline by sequencing some document processors.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Clone:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;Clone
    the Pipeline currently selected. This is pretty much the same as creating a
    new one, beside the fact that document processor sequence is copied.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Delete:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;Delete
    the Pipeline currently selected. This operation does not delete the document
    processors forming the Pipeline.</font></li>
</ul>
